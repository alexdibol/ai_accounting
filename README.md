# AI for Audit & Accounting

## What this repository contains
This repository supports the book **AI for Audit & Accounting**, an educational, governance-first guide for **U.S. audit and accounting practice**.

It is designed to help CPAs, auditors, and accounting leaders develop a clear mental model of what generative AI can do **today**, where it introduces new risks, and how it can be used responsibly under **GAAS, PCAOB, SOX/ICFR, and U.S. tax practice** constraints.

The focus is not speed or automation, but **professional defensibility, traceability, and auditability**.

## The book’s core idea: a five-level maturity ladder
This book treats generative AI **not as an authority**, but as a tool whose usefulness depends on **controls, verification, and accountability**.

It presents a five-level maturity ladder that progresses from individual assistance to organization-grade operations:

- **Level 1 — Chatbots:** supervised drafting of memos, emails, and workpapers  
- **Level 2 — Reasoners:** structured issue spotting, alternatives, variance and exception hypotheses  
- **Level 3 — Agents:** multi-step workflows with human checkpoints and immutable logs  
- **Level 4 — Innovators:** reusable, tested AI assets such as playbooks, templates, and evaluation harnesses  
- **Level 5 — Organizations:** an end-to-end operating model with intake, independence checks, risk assessment, QA, sign-off, archiving, and retrieval  

At every level, **facts are separated from assumptions**, and all outputs default to **“Not verified.”**

## What makes this governance-first (and why that matters in accounting)
The focus is professional accountability and audit readiness. Each chapter emphasizes controls that make AI-assisted work safer to review and harder to misuse:

- Explicit separation of **generation vs. verification**  
- Clear labeling of **facts provided, assumptions, open items, and risks**  
- No invented standards, guidance, or authoritative citations  
- Governance-native artifacts: run manifests, prompt logs, risk logs, versioned deliverables, and review sign-offs  
- Human CPA review required for any reliance-bearing output  

These controls are designed to align with real audit, accounting, and regulatory expectations.

---

## Recurring mini-cases used across all chapters
Each level is demonstrated using the same four recurring case types:

- **Financial statement audit (GAAS / PCAOB)**  
- **SOX / ICFR**  
- **Tax and ASC 740 / filings**  
- **Teaching and methodology**  

Each chapter concludes with a **minimum standard checklist** that can be adopted directly in practice.

## Important note (read carefully)
This repository and book are **educational materials**. They are **not audit, accounting, tax, or legal advice**.

All AI-generated outputs must be reviewed and verified by qualified professionals before any reliance-bearing use. Confidentiality, independence, professional skepticism, and supervision obligations apply at every level.

Do **not** input sensitive or confidential client information into external AI tools. Use redaction and “minimum necessary” inputs by default.
