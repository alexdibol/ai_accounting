Artificial intelligence promises to transform how we work, offering capabilities that seemed impossible just years ago. Yet this same power introduces profound risks. An AI system that can draft complex workpapers in seconds might also hallucinate citations, overstate conclusions, or inadvertently leak confidential client information. For CPAs bound by professional standards and ethical obligations, the question isn't whether to use AI, but how to use it responsibly within our existing frameworks of quality control, independence, and client protection.\n","\n","This notebook addresses that question directly. It represents Chapter 3 in a progressive framework that moves from simple AI queries to sophisticated multi-step workflows. Where earlier chapters covered basic prompting and document analysis, this chapter introduces Level 3 agents that orchestrate complete workflows spanning intake, planning, drafting, quality control, and finalization. These agents don't work in isolation. They operate within a governance system explicitly designed for professional services, with human checkpoints at critical decision points, immutable audit trails documenting every action, and automated controls that prevent common failure modes.\n","\n","The fundamental insight driving this work is simple but powerful: capability increases risk, and risk requires controls. As AI systems become more capable, moving from answering questions to coordinating multi-step processes, the potential for harm grows proportionally. A system that drafts audit workpapers could easily drift into implying that procedures were performed or evidence was obtained, crossing the bright line between planning artifacts and completed work. A system processing client data could accidentally log sensitive information or respond to prompt injection attacks designed to exfiltrate confidential details. Without proper controls, increased capability becomes increased liability.\n","\n","This notebook implements a governance-first architecture where controls aren't afterthoughts bolted onto powerful AI capabilities, but rather foundational elements present from the first line of code. Before any AI interaction occurs, the system establishes logging infrastructure, redaction utilities, and checkpoint mechanisms. Before any workflow begins, the system documents its configuration, captures environmental details for reproducibility, and creates registers for tracking assumptions versus facts. Before any drafting happens, the system verifies that critical unknowns aren't blocking downstream work. This inverted approach, building controls first and capabilities second, ensures safety by design rather than safety by hope.\n","\n","**What Happens in This Chapter: A Multi-Agent Architecture**\n","\n","The notebook constructs a complete multi-agent system implemented in pure Python without relying on abstract frameworks or magical automation. You'll build five specialist agents, each with focused responsibilities mirroring roles on real professional services engagements. The IntakeAgent structures raw case information into facts, assumptions, and open questions, explicitly distinguishing what's known from what's assumed. The PlannerAgent creates workflow plans showing required steps, evidence needs, and checkpoint schedules. The DraftAgent produces workpaper shells, documentation templates, and analysis frameworks, but only after verifying that critical unknowns aren't blocking the work.\n","\n","The QCReviewerAgent acts as independent quality control, scanning draft outputs for overclaims, missing disclaimers, and unclear distinctions between facts and assumptions. The RiskAssessorAgent monitors workflow integrity, verifying all required steps completed and no gaps exist in the audit trail. These five specialists work together under the coordination of an OrchestratorAgent that manages the state machine, enforces checkpoint gates, versions deliverables, and ensures nothing proceeds without proper approval.\n","\n","This division of labor isn't arbitrary. It mirrors how professional services firms actually structure engagement teams, with different people handling intake, planning, execution, and quality review. By encoding this organizational wisdom into the agent architecture, the system inherits decades of practice management experience about why certain separations of duties reduce risk and improve quality.\n","\n","**Human Checkpoints: Where Judgment Cannot Be Delegated**\n","\n","The most critical feature of Level 3 workflows is explicit human checkpoints at four gates: intake approval, plan approval, pre-delivery quality control, and final sign-off. At each gate, the workflow stops completely until a human reviewer examines the work completed so far and provides explicit approval to proceed. The system doesn't ask politely whether you'd like to review, it blocks execution until approval is granted or the workflow is terminated.\n","\n","These checkpoints aren't bureaucratic obstacles, they're recognition that certain judgments cannot be delegated to AI systems no matter how sophisticated. Deciding whether a workflow plan adequately addresses engagement risks requires professional judgment informed by years of experience, firm methodologies, and client-specific knowledge. Determining whether draft workpapers are ready for delivery requires understanding not just what the documents say, but what professional standards require and what engagement economics permit. These judgments belong to licensed professionals who bear ultimate responsibility for engagement quality and client outcomes.\n","\n","The checkpoint mechanism also creates natural intervention points where humans can redirect workflows that have drifted off course, add information that changes planning assumptions, or terminate work that isn't producing value. Without these gates, an automated workflow might continue executing long after a human would have recognized futility and stopped. With them, professional judgment remains in control even as AI handles mechanical aspects of work production.\n","\n","**Facts Are Not Assumptions: The Discipline That Prevents Disasters**\n","\n","Perhaps the most important innovation in this governance framework is the assumption register with hinge fact blocking. The system maintains explicit registers distinguishing what's actually known from what's being assumed. Each assumption gets tagged with whether it's a hinge fact, meaning a critical unknown whose resolution could fundamentally change downstream work. If hinge facts remain unresolved when drafting begins, the system blocks execution and refuses to proceed until those facts are resolved or a human explicitly overrides the block.\n","\n","This discipline prevents the classic professional services failure mode where teams draft conclusions before gathering sufficient evidence, then face expensive rework when late-breaking information contradicts earlier assumptions. By forcing explicit acknowledgment of assumptions and blocking work that depends on unresolved critical unknowns, the system automates professional skepticism that might otherwise depend entirely on individual judgment and attention.\n","\n","The assumption register also creates transparency for reviewers. Instead of having to infer what a workpaper assumes by reading between the lines, reviewers can examine the register and see explicitly what was known versus assumed at each stage. This transparency dramatically improves reviewability and reduces the cognitive load on quality control reviewers who might otherwise spend hours trying to reconstruct the factual basis for conclusions.\n","\n","**Immutable Audit Trails: Cryptographic Integrity**\n","\n","Every interaction with Claude gets logged in an append-only file with cryptographic hash chaining. Each log entry includes redacted versions of the prompt and response, SHA-256 fingerprints of both, a timestamp, model parameters, and the hash of the previous entry. This creates a chain where each entry is cryptographically linked to its predecessor. If anyone attempts to alter a log entry after creation, the hash chain breaks, making tampering immediately detectable.\n","\n","This immutability matters because professional work often faces scrutiny months or years after completion. Regulators, litigators, or peer reviewers may question what happened, when decisions were made, and what information was available at each stage. An immutable audit trail provides definitive answers to these questions. The hash chain proves the log hasn't been altered retroactively to make past decisions look better than they were.\n","\n","The logging system also captures configuration hashes and environment fingerprints, enabling reproducibility. Someone reviewing the work can see exactly which model version was used, what temperature and token settings applied, what Python version and operating system were running, and what key packages were installed. If results need verification or unexpected differences appear between runs, this environmental context helps explain whether differences stem from changed configurations or genuine variations in model behavior.\n","\n","**Automated Risk Detection: Catching Problems Immediately**\n","\n","The system implements automated scanning for common risk patterns. It detects when responses lack open questions, suggesting the AI might be overconfident or missing important unknowns. It flags authority tokens like ASC, PCAOB, AICPA, or SEC that might indicate hallucinated citations. It catches implied performance verbs like we tested or we obtained that violate the draft-only boundary. It identifies prompt injection attempts where input text contains suspicious phrases trying to manipulate the AI's behavior.\n","\n","Each detected risk generates a log entry with severity level, risk type, and explanatory note. These automated flags don't replace human judgment, but they dramatically reduce the chance that problems slip through unnoticed. A reviewer examining dozens of deliverables can prioritize attention on those flagged with high-severity risks rather than reading everything with equal scrutiny.\n","\n","**Why This Matters for Professional Practice**\n","\n","This notebook represents more than a technical exercise. It's a blueprint for how professional services firms can adopt powerful AI capabilities while maintaining the quality controls, ethical standards, and risk management that clients and regulators expect. The governance framework demonstrated here, with its checkpoints, registers, immutable logs, and automated controls, provides a path forward that doesn't require choosing between innovation and responsibility. Firms can have both, but only if they build governance into the foundation rather than treating it as an afterthought.\n","\n","The four demonstration cases covering financial statement audits, internal controls, tax positions, and training materials show the framework's flexibility across different service lines. The same orchestrator, agents, and controls work regardless of technical domain. This consistency matters because firms need governance approaches that scale across practices rather than requiring different control systems for every engagement type.\n","\n","Most importantly, this notebook operationalizes the principle that AI should augment rather than replace professional judgment. The agents handle mechanical tasks like structuring intake, drafting templates, and scanning for common issues. The humans make judgments about whether plans are adequate, whether drafts are ready for delivery, and whether work products meet professional standards. This division of labor positions AI as a powerful tool that makes professionals more effective rather than as a replacement that makes professionals obsolete."],"metadata":{"id":"6n-x0MLbMKUs"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##2.LIBRARIES AND ENVIRONMENT"],"metadata":{"id":"HzSSYRQ0MKs8"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Cell 2: Install + Imports + Run Directory\n","\n","# Install Anthropic SDK\n","!pip install -q anthropic\n","\n","# Core imports\n","import json\n","import os\n","import re\n","import hashlib\n","import platform\n","import textwrap\n","import subprocess\n","import uuid\n","from pathlib import Path\n","from datetime import datetime, timezone\n","\n","# Create run directory with timestamp\n","timestamp = datetime.now(timezone.utc).strftime(\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\")\n","RUN_BASE_DIR = Path(f\"/content/ai_audit_ch3_runs/run_{timestamp}\")\n","RUN_BASE_DIR.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\n","\n","# Create deliverables subdirectory\n","DELIVERABLES_DIR = RUN_BASE_DIR / \"deliverables\"\n","DELIVERABLES_DIR.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\n","\n","print(\"✓ Packages installed\")\n","print(f\"✓ Run directory created: {RUN_BASE_DIR}\")\n","print(f\"✓ Deliverables directory: {DELIVERABLES_DIR}\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"CXdhfdQfiLVv","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1768227052860,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":4171,"user":{"displayName":"Alejandro Reynoso del Valle","userId":"04174712603211483042"}},"outputId":"418e9e3a-8f78-4ab3-a55b-f2d834a2f79e"},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\u001b[?25l   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m0.0/388.2 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m?\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m-:--:--\u001b[0m\r\u001b[2K   \u001b[91m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m\u001b[90m╺\u001b[0m \u001b[32m378.9/388.2 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m14.4 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:01\u001b[0m\r\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m388.2/388.2 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m10.8 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25h✓ Packages installed\n","✓ Run directory created: /content/ai_audit_ch3_runs/run_20260112_141053\n","✓ Deliverables directory: /content/ai_audit_ch3_runs/run_20260112_141053/deliverables\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##3.CONFIGURATION AND RUN INITIALIZATION"],"metadata":{"id":"STtjBQgwMNHi"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###3.1.OVERVIEW"],"metadata":{"id":"ShWjt_vyMO17"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Cell 3: Connecting to the AI Model (API Key Setup)**\n","\n","This cell is where we establish the connection between your notebook and Anthropic's Claude AI model. Think of it like plugging in a power cord before you can use an appliance. Without this connection, nothing else in the notebook will work.\n","\n","**What Happens in This Cell**\n","\n","First, the cell retrieves your API key from Google Colab's secure storage system called \"Secrets.\" An API key is like a password that proves you have permission to use Claude. Google Colab keeps this key hidden so nobody else can see it or steal it, even if they look at your notebook code.\n","\n","The cell then does three important setup tasks. It loads the Anthropic library (the toolkit for talking to Claude), it stores your API key in a place where the rest of the notebook can use it, and it creates a \"client\" object that acts as your messenger to send requests to Claude and receive responses.\n","\n","**Model Configuration Settings**\n","\n","After establishing the connection, the cell sets up three critical parameters that control how Claude behaves. The model name specifies exactly which version of Claude you're using. For this notebook, we use claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929, which is a specific snapshot of Claude Sonnet that balances intelligence with speed.\n","\n","The temperature setting (0.2) controls how creative or predictable Claude's responses will be. Low temperatures like 0.2 make Claude very consistent and focused, which is exactly what we want for audit work where reliability matters more than creativity. High temperatures would make Claude more imaginative but less predictable.\n","\n","The max tokens setting (1200) limits how long Claude's responses can be. Tokens are pieces of words, and 1200 tokens equals roughly 900-1000 words. This prevents Claude from writing excessively long responses that would slow down the workflow or cost too much money.\n","\n","**Error Handling**\n","\n","The cell includes friendly error messages. If your API key is missing or incorrect, you'll see clear instructions telling you exactly how to add it to Colab Secrets. This prevents confusing technical errors later.\n","\n","**Confirmation Output**\n","\n","When the cell runs successfully, it prints confirmation messages showing that your API key loaded correctly and displays the exact model configuration being used.

These phrases appear in prompt injection attacks where malicious users try to make the AI ignore its safety rules or leak sensitive information.\n","\n","When the scanner detects these patterns, it flags them as suspicious and logs a high-severity risk entry. This doesn't automatically block the workflow, but it alerts you that something unusual is happening. Maybe a legitimate user accidentally pasted text containing these phrases, or maybe someone is genuinely trying to exploit the system. Either way, you need to know about it.\n","\n","**The Demonstration: Seeing Protection in Action**\n","\n","The cell includes a demonstration using fake data containing all the problematic elements: an email address, a phone number, a social security number, a street address, and a prompt injection attempt. When you run the cell, you can see exactly how each protection works. The redaction function masks the sensitive details. The minimum-necessary builder extracts core facts. The injection scanner flags the suspicious phrase.

It's not just a simple messenger, it's an intelligent wrapper that enforces structure, monitors quality, maintains audit trails, and automatically detects problems. Think of it as a sophisticated quality control inspector stationed at the gateway, examining everything going out to Claude and everything coming back, while keeping detailed records of every interaction.\n","\n","**The System Prompt: Setting Clear Boundaries**\n","\n","Before sending any request to Claude, this wrapper includes a system prompt that acts like a job description and rule book combined. It explicitly tells Claude this is Level 3 work involving workflow orchestration with human checkpoints. It reminds Claude that all outputs are drafts requiring CPA review. Most importantly, it states what Claude must not do: perform procedures, obtain evidence, verify facts, or make authoritative conclusions.\n","\n","The system prompt also enforces a strict output format. Claude must return valid JSON with specific keys in exact order: task, facts_provided, assumptions, open_questions, analysis, risks, draft_output, verification_status, and questions_to_verify. This structured format makes outputs machine-readable and ensures consistency across all AI interactions. The prompt provides explicit rules like analysis should explain workflow reasoning not technical conclusions, and draft_output must begin with the not advice disclaimer.\n","\n","**JSON Parsing with Retry Logic**\n","\n","When Claude responds, the wrapper attempts to parse the response as JSON. Sometimes Claude wraps JSON in markdown formatting or makes small syntax errors. The wrapper first tries to extract clean JSON, handling common formatting issues automatically. If parsing fails, it doesn't just give up. Instead, it makes a second attempt, sending Claude a focused request to fix the JSON syntax only. This retry logic dramatically reduces failures from minor formatting problems.\n","\n","If both attempts fail, the wrapper logs a high-severity risk entry documenting the parse failure and returns an error object. This fail-closed behavior ensures problems get recorded and workflows stop safely rather than proceeding with corrupted data.\n","\n","**Hash Chain for Immutable Audit Trail**\n","\n","Every interaction gets logged with cryptographic hash chaining. The wrapper computes fingerprints of the redacted prompt and response. It then creates an entry hash that depends on the current prompt hash, response hash, and the previous entry's hash. This creates a chain where each log entry is cryptographically linked to the one before it.\n","\n","Why does this matter? If anyone tries to alter a log entry after the fact, the hash chain breaks. Reviewers can verify the chain remains intact, proving the log hasn't been tampered with. The chain starts with a genesis hash of sixty-four zeros, and each subsequent entry references its predecessor, creating an unbreakable audit trail.\n","\n","**Automated Risk Detection**\n","\n","The wrapper runs four automated checks on every successful response. It flags missing open questions, suggesting the AI might not be identifying unknowns properly. It detects authority tokens like ASC, PCAOB, AICPA, or SEC, which might indicate invented citations. It scans for implied performance verbs like we tested or we verified, which violate the Level 3 boundary. It catches authoritative conclusion language that oversteps the draft-only mandate.\n","\n","Each detected issue generates a risk log entry with appropriate severity. This automated scanning catches problems immediately rather than hoping human reviewers notice them later. The risk log becomes a map showing where quality issues occurred.\n","\n","**The Smoke Test: Verification Before Proceeding**\n","\n","The cell ends with a smoke test that makes a simple request to Claude and verifies valid JSON comes back. This confirms your API connection works, Claude is responding appropriately, and the wrapper logic functions correctly before you run actual case workflows."],"metadata":{"id":"NbI8D2MMNp2V"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###6.2.CODE AND IMPLEMENTATION"],"metadata":{"id":"HYi01MJHM25b"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Cell 6: LLM Wrapper: Strict JSON Call + Automated Risk Flags\n","\n","# Global variable to track previous log entry hash for hash chaining\n","PREV_LOG_HASH = \"0\" * 64  # Genesis hash\n","\n","def call_llm_strict_json(task_name, agent_name, step_id, user_prompt, facts_bullets, case_id=\"default\"):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Call LLM with strict JSON enforcement and automated risk flagging.\n","    Returns: (parsed_json_dict, success_flag)\n","    \"\"\"\n","    global PREV_LOG_HASH\n","\n","    # Redact user prompt\n","    redacted_prompt, _ = redact(user_prompt)\n","\n","    # Build facts string\n","    facts_str = \"\\n\".join([f\"- {f}\" for f in facts_bullets]) if facts_bullets else \"(No facts provided)\"\n","\n","    # System prompt enforcing Level 3 boundary\n","    system_prompt = \"\"\"You are an AI assistant helping CPAs with audit/accounting workflows at Level 3.\n","\n","CRITICAL BOUNDARY (Level 3):\n","- You orchestrate multi-step workflows with human checkpoints\n","- You create DRAFT planning artifacts only\n","- You DO NOT perform procedures, obtain evidence, or verify facts\n","- You DO NOT make authoritative conclusions\n","- All outputs require CPA review and engagement sign-off\n","\n","STRICT OUTPUT FORMAT - Return ONLY valid JSON with keys in EXACT order:\n","{\n","  \"task\": \"...\",\n","  \"facts_provided\": [...],\n","  \"assumptions\": [...],\n","  \"open_questions\": [...],\n","  \"analysis\": \"...\",\n","  \"risks\": [\n","    {\"type\": \"confidentiality|independence|hallucination|missing_facts|qc|prompt_injection|overreach|other\",\n","     \"severity\": \"low|medium|high\",\n","     \"note\": \"...\"}\n","  ],\n","  \"draft_output\": \"...\",\n","  \"verification_status\": \"Not verified\",\n","  \"questions_to_verify\": [...]\n","}\n","\n","RULES:\n","- analysis = workflow reasoning (why these steps/checkpoints), NOT technical conclusions\n","- draft_output MUST begin with: \"NOT ACCOUNTING/AUDIT/TAX ADVICE.

Think of it like staffing a professional services engagement team with specialists for intake, planning, drafting, quality control, and risk assessment, then establishing the sign-off gates where partners must approve work before it proceeds to the next phase.\n","\n","**The Shared State: Central Knowledge Repositories**\n","\n","The SHARED_STATE dictionary acts as a central filing system that all agents can access and update. It contains four critical registers. The assumption_register tracks everything the workflow is assuming rather than knowing for certain. Each assumption entry includes whether it's a hinge fact, meaning a critical unknown that could invalidate downstream work if left unresolved. The open_items_register lists questions and evidence needs that must be addressed. The not_verified_register captures statements that reference authorities or standards but haven't been verified against source documents. The checkpoint_history register records every approval decision, who made it, and when.\n","\n","These registers serve multiple purposes. They make implicit knowledge explicit by forcing agents to document what they're assuming versus what they know. They create accountability by assigning owners to each open item. They enable blocking behavior where unresolved hinge facts can stop the workflow until addressed. Most importantly, they provide transparency so human reviewers can see exactly what gaps and uncertainties exist in the work.\n","\n","**Helper Functions: Managing the Registers**\n","\n","Three simple functions let agents add entries to the registers. The add_assumption function creates assumption entries, automatically generating unique identifiers and timestamps. It marks whether each assumption is a hinge fact based on keywords like material, significant, or critical. The add_open_item function tracks questions and evidence needs. The add_not_verified function captures unverified authority references. A fourth function, get_unresolved_hinge_facts, retrieves all open hinge facts for a specific case, which feeds into the blocking logic.\n","\n","**The Checkpoint Gate: Human Approval Mechanism**\n","\n","The require_approval function implements the human checkpoint gates. When called, it prints a clear banner showing which checkpoint has been reached and which case is being reviewed. In production mode, it waits for human input, requiring someone to type approve before proceeding. In demo mode with auto_approve set to true, it automatically approves for testing purposes.\n","\n","Every checkpoint decision gets logged to both the checkpoint_history register and the immutable prompts log with hash chaining. This creates a permanent record of who approved what and when. If approval is declined, the function logs a high-severity risk entry and returns a not-approved status, which signals the orchestrator to stop the workflow safely and bundle up whatever work has been completed so far.\n","\n","**Hinge Fact Enforcement: The Blocking Mechanism**\n","\n","The check_hinge_facts_block function implements one of the most important controls in the entire system. Before any drafting work proceeds, it checks whether unresolved hinge facts exist for the case. If it finds critical unknowns that haven't been resolved, it prints a warning listing each unresolved item. In production mode, it blocks the workflow completely, logging a high-severity risk entry and stopping execution unless the human reviewer provides an explicit override by typing override.\n","\n","This blocking behavior prevents the classic audit mistake of drafting conclusions before gathering sufficient evidence. If you don't know something critical, you shouldn't be drafting work that depends on knowing it. The hinge fact mechanism makes this discipline automatic rather than relying on individual judgment.\n","\n","**The Specialist Agents: Division of Labor**\n","\n","Five agent classes handle different workflow phases. IntakeAgent structures raw case input into facts, assumptions, and open questions. It checks for prompt injection, builds minimum-necessary fact sets, calls Claude with the structured prompt, and populates the registers based on Claude's response. PlannerAgent creates step-by-step workflow plans with checkpoints and evidence needs. DraftAgent creates workpaper shells and documentation templates, but only after checking that hinge facts don't block the work.\n","\n","QCReviewerAgent acts as the quality control reviewer. It scans draft outputs for overclaims like we tested or we verified, checks for missing disclaimers, and generates QC review notes identifying issues. It represents the independent second look that catches problems before deliverables go out. RiskAssessorAgent performs workflow integrity checks, verifying that all required steps completed and flagging any missing outputs or unresolved assumptions.\n","\n","This division of labor mirrors real professional services teams where different people handle intake, planning, execution, and quality review. Each agent has a clear, focused responsibility rather than trying to do everything at once."],"metadata":{"id":"EKvlFydjNrmX"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###7.2.CODE AND IMPLEMENTATION"],"metadata":{"id":"X1KSLRldNBYW"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Cell 7: Agent Classes + Registers + Checkpoint Gate\n","\n","# ============================================================================\n","# SHARED STATE (Registers)\n","# ============================================================================\n","\n","SHARED_STATE = {\n","    \"assumption_register\": [],\n","    \"open_items_register\": [],\n","    \"not_verified_register\": [],\n","    \"checkpoint_history\": []\n","}\n","\n","def add_assumption(item, is_hinge_fact=False, case_id=\"default\"):\n","    \"\"\"Add item to assumption register\"\"\"\n","    entry = {\n","        \"id\": str(uuid.uuid4())[:8],\n","        \"case_id\": case_id,\n","        \"item\": item,\n","        \"is_hinge_fact\": is_hinge_fact,\n","        \"status\": \"open\",\n","        \"owner\": \"(to be assigned)\",\n","        \"added_utc\": now_iso()\n","    }\n","    SHARED_STATE[\"assumption_register\"].append(entry)\n","    return entry\n","\n","def add_open_item(item, case_id=\"default\"):\n","    \"\"\"Add item to open items register\"\"\"\n","    entry = {\n","        \"id\": str(uuid.uuid4())[:8],\n","        \"case_id\": case_id,\n","        \"item\": item,\n","        \"status\": \"open\",\n","        \"owner\": \"(to be assigned)\",\n","        \"added_utc\": now_iso()\n","    }\n","    SHARED_STATE[\"open_items_register\"].append(entry)\n","    return entry\n","\n","def add_not_verified(item, case_id=\"default\"):\n","    \"\"\"Add item to not verified register\"\"\"\n","    entry = {\n","        \"id\": str(uuid.uuid4())[:8],\n","        \"case_id\": case_id,\n","        \"item\": item,\n","        \"added_utc\": now_iso()\n","    }\n","    SHARED_STATE[\"not_verified_register\"].append(entry)\n","    return entry\n","\n","def get_unresolved_hinge_facts(case_id):\n","    \"\"\"Get list of unresolved hinge facts for a case\"\"\"\n","    return [a for a in SHARED_STATE[\"assumption_register\"]\n","            if a[\"case_id\"] == case_id and a[\"is_hinge_fact\"] and a[\"status\"] == \"open\"]\n","\n","# ============================================================================\n","# CHECKPOINT GATE\n","# ============================================================================\n","\n","def require_approval(checkpoint_name, case_id, auto_approve=False):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Require human approval at checkpoint.\n","    Returns: (approved, approver_name)\n","    \"\"\"\n","    print(f\"\\n{'='*60}\")\n","    print(f\"CHECKPOINT: {checkpoint_name}\")\n","    print(f\"Case: {case_id}\")\n","    print(f\"{'='*60}\")\n","\n","    if auto_approve:\n","        print(\"✓ AUTO-APPROVED (demo mode)\")\n","        approver = \"AUTO\"\n","        approved = True\n","    else:\n","        print(\"\\nReview artifacts and approve to proceed.\")\n","        print(\"Type 'approve' to continue, or anything else to stop:\")\n","        user_input = input(\"> \").strip().lower()\n","        approved = user_input == \"approve\"\n","        approver = \"Human reviewer\" if approved else \"Declined\"\n","\n","        if approved:\n","            print(\"✓ APPROVED -

The orchestrator doesn't do the specialist work itself, instead it calls the right agents at the right time, enforces checkpoint gates, maintains state across steps, versions all deliverables, and ensures nothing proceeds without proper approval. Think of it as the project manager who keeps a complex engagement moving forward while enforcing quality controls at every stage.\n","\n","**The Orchestrator Class: Managing Complex Workflows**\n","\n","The OrchestratorAgent class maintains a dictionary tracking all cases being processed. For each case, it stores the case identifier and name, all step outputs produced so far, paths to deliverables, the current version number, and workflow status. This state tracking is essential because workflows span multiple steps over time. The orchestrator needs to remember what happened in earlier steps so later steps can build on that foundation.\n","\n","When you start a new case, the orchestrator creates a dedicated folder in the deliverables directory. This keeps all artifacts for one case together and separate from other cases. The folder structure makes it easy for human reviewers to find everything related to a specific engagement or client matter.\n","\n","**The Six-Stage State Machine: Linear Progression with Gates**\n","\n","The run_workflow method implements a six-stage state machine with checkpoint gates between stages. Stage one runs IntakeAgent to structure the raw input into facts, assumptions, and questions. If intake succeeds, the orchestrator saves the intake result and then stops at the intake_approval checkpoint. Only after human approval does it proceed to stage two.\n","\n","Stage two runs PlannerAgent to create a workflow plan with evidence needs and timeline. Again, success leads to saving the plan and stopping at plan_approval checkpoint. Stage three drafts multiple artifacts based on case type. For a financial statement audit, it might draft a hypotheses matrix, disconfirming questions, and workpaper memo shell. For a SOX control review, it drafts control narratives, design gap analysis, and test approach documents. The orchestrator looks at the case name to determine which artifacts are appropriate.\n","\n","Stage four runs QCReviewerAgent to examine one of the draft artifacts, checking for facts versus assumptions clarity, overclaims, and missing disclaimers. The QC review notes get saved, and the workflow stops at pre_delivery_qc checkpoint. Stage five runs RiskAssessorAgent to perform workflow integrity checks, verifying all required steps completed and no critical gaps exist. Stage six finalizes the registers, saving assumption_register and open_items_register as permanent artifacts, then stops at final_signoff checkpoint.\n","\n","This linear progression with gates ensures work can't skip ahead without approval. You can't draft workpapers until the plan is approved. You can't finalize deliverables until QC review is complete. The state machine enforces discipline that might otherwise depend entirely on individual judgment and memory.\n","\n","**Artifact Type Mapping: Case-Specific Intelligence**\n","\n","The get_draft_artifacts_for_case method demonstrates how the orchestrator adapts to different case types. It maintains a mapping showing financial statement audits need hypotheses matrices and workpaper memos, SOX reviews need control narratives and deficiency memos, tax matters need UTP memo shells and verification checklists, and teaching cases need training guides and rubrics. The orchestrator examines the case name and automatically selects appropriate artifacts, eliminating manual configuration for each case.\n","\n","**Versioned Deliverables: Tracking Iterations**\n","\n","The save_deliverable method implements versioning for all outputs. When saving a file, it prepends a version number like v001 to the filename. If you rerun the same case later, the version increments to v002, v003, and so on. This preserves the entire history of iterations rather than overwriting previous versions. Reviewers can see how outputs evolved over multiple runs. The method also creates human-readable text files alongside JSON files when draft outputs exist, making it easier for CPAs to review content without parsing JSON.\n","\n","**Register Finalization: Permanent Documentation**\n","\n","The save_registers method takes all assumption and open items entries for a case and writes them to permanent JSON files in the case folder. These registers become part of the deliverable package. They document what was assumed, what wasn't known, what's been resolved, and what remains open. Future reviewers or team members picking up the work can see exactly where things stand.\n","\n","**Bundle Finalization: Wrapping Up Safely**\n","\n","The finalize_bundle method creates a case summary JSON file documenting the final status, whether the workflow completed successfully or stopped early, which deliverables were produced, and when finalization occurred. This summary provides a quick overview without having to examine every individual artifact.

Each case represents a different type of professional services engagement, from financial statement audits to tax matters to internal training. Think of this as the dress rehearsal where you run realistic scenarios to verify everything works properly before using the system on actual client matters. The demonstrations prove the concepts aren't just theoretical, they actually function in practice.\n","\n","**The Four Demonstration Cases: Realistic Scenarios**\n","\n","The DEMO_CASES list contains four carefully designed synthetic scenarios. Case one is a financial statement audit examining year-over-year revenue variance. The input describes revenue increasing twenty-three percent while gross margin declined, with management providing a bridge analysis. It includes an intentional gap around new customer concentration, forcing the system to identify this as an open question requiring investigation. This mirrors real audit situations where initial management explanations raise follow-up questions.\n","\n","Case two addresses SOX internal control over financial reporting. It describes an IT-dependent manual control where the controller reviews an aging report from the ERP system. The walkthrough notes are deliberately incomplete, missing details about who configured report parameters and what IT general controls exist. This incompleteness should trigger the system to flag missing design elements and generate questions about segregation of duties and change management controls.\n","\n","Case three tackles a tax uncertain tax position involving transfer pricing between related entities. The input explicitly states no authority text is provided, setting up a situation where the system must acknowledge this gap and request necessary documentation rather than pretending to have information it doesn't. This tests whether the not verified discipline actually works in practice.\n","\n","Case four involves creating training materials about Level 3 workflows for firm staff. The audience is senior associates and managers with minimal AI background. This meta-case asks the system to explain itself, testing whether it can articulate checkpoints, logs, registers, and QC responsibilities in plain language appropriate for the target audience. It also asks about common pitfalls when reviewing AI-generated work, requiring the system to demonstrate self-awareness about its own limitations.\n","\n","**The Execution Loop: Processing Each Case**\n","\n","The cell runs a loop processing all four cases sequentially. For each case, it prints a clear banner showing which case is starting, then calls the orchestrator's run_workflow method with the case identifier, case name, raw input, and auto_approve set to true. In production use, auto_approve would be false, forcing actual human review at each checkpoint. For demonstrations, automatic approval lets the entire workflow complete without interruption so you can see the full end-to-end process.\n","\n","After each case completes, the orchestrator returns a summary showing the final status and how many deliverables were produced. The cell prints this summary, giving you immediate feedback about whether the case succeeded or failed and at what stage any failure occurred. All four summaries get collected in a demo_results list for later analysis.\n","\n","**The Summary Table: Aggregated Metrics**\n","\n","After all cases complete, the cell generates a summary table showing key metrics across all four cases. The table has five columns: case name, number of open questions identified, count of unresolved hinge facts, maximum risk severity encountered, and final workflow status. This table format makes it easy to compare cases and spot patterns.\n","\n","The cell calculates each metric by examining the appropriate data structures. Open questions come from summing the open_questions arrays across all step outputs for that case. Unresolved hinge facts come from querying the assumption register for entries marked as hinge facts with open status. Maximum risk severity comes from examining all risk log entries for that case and finding whether any high-severity risks were logged. The status comes directly from the orchestrator's final case status.\n","\n","**Deliverables Path Display: Finding Your Work**\n","\n","After the summary table, the cell prints the file system paths where all deliverables were saved. Each case has its own subfolder under the deliverables directory. You can navigate to these folders using the Colab file browser to examine individual JSON files or text renderings. This makes the abstract concept of deliverables concrete by showing you exactly where to look.\n","\n","**What You Should See: Expected Outcomes**\n","\n","When this cell runs successfully, you should see four complete workflows execute with multiple checkpoint approvals per case. You should see agents processing intake, creating plans, drafting artifacts, and performing QC reviews. The summary table should show all four cases reached completed status. You should see varying numbers of open questions across cases, reflecting the different levels of information gaps in each scenario. You should see some cases flagged with high-severity risks, particularly where authority tokens or missing facts were detected.\n","\n","The demonstration proves the entire governance system works as intended. Checkpoints fired at the right moments. Registers populated correctly. Risk flags triggered appropriately. Versioned deliverables saved to proper locations. Hash-chained logs maintained immutability. The auto-approve mode let you see the complete flow, but you understand that production use would require genuine human review at each gate.\n","\n","**Learning from the Demonstrations: Pedagogical Value**\n","\n","These demonstrations serve educational purposes beyond just testing functionality. By seeing four different case types processed through identical workflow machinery, you understand the system's flexibility. The same orchestrator, agents, and controls work for audits, internal control reviews, tax positions, and training materials. You also see how intentionally incomplete inputs force the system to acknowledge gaps rather than inventing information. This reinforces the facts-not-assumptions discipline that makes Level 3 agents trustworthy for professional services use."],"metadata":{"id":"D8amiPeIsLVj"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###9.2.CODE AND IMPLEMENTATION"],"metadata":{"id":"q65FZs56NXZp"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Cell 9: Run 4 Mini-Case Demos + Save Deliverables\n","\n","# ============================================================================\n","# MINI-CASE INPUTS (Synthetic/Sanitized)\n","# ============================================================================\n","\n","DEMO_CASES = [\n","    {\n","        \"case_id\": \"case1_fs_audit\",\n","        \"case_name\": \"FS Audit - Revenue Variance\",\n","        \"raw_input\": \"\"\"\n","YoY revenue increased 23% from $45M to $55M.

Think of it as preparing the engagement file for archival storage or peer review. Everything someone needs to understand what happened, verify the work, or reproduce the results gets bundled together with clear instructions. This final packaging step transforms scattered artifacts into a complete, reviewable audit trail.\n","\n","**The Audit README: Your User Manual**\n","\n","The cell creates a detailed AUDIT_README text file that serves as the instruction manual for reviewing this run. The README starts by identifying the run with its unique identifier, timestamp, and author attribution. This header information lets reviewers immediately know what they're looking at and when it was created.\n","\n","The README then explains what's in the bundle, describing each of the five artifact types. For run_manifest.json, it explains this contains the run identification, model configuration, config hash for verification, and environment fingerprint for reproducibility. For prompts_log.jsonl, it describes the append-only log structure with redacted interactions, SHA-256 hashes, and hash chain for immutability. It emphasizes treating this log as sensitive even though it's redacted, and clarifies it's for audit trail purposes not for re-prompting the model.\n","\n","For risk_log.json, the README lists the types of risks that get logged, from confidentiality and hallucination to workflow integrity gaps. It advises reviewers to filter for high-severity entries and understand context before escalating concerns. For the deliverables folder, it explains the versioned artifact structure, the JSON format for structured data, and optional text renderings for human readability. It lists what you'll find in each case folder including step outputs, QC notes, and registers.\n","\n","**How to Review This Run: Step-by-Step Guidance**\n","\n","The README provides a five-step review process. Step one instructs reviewers to start with run_manifest.json, verify the configuration matches expectations, note the config hash and environment fingerprint, and confirm all governance controls are listed. This initial review establishes the foundation for understanding everything else.\n","\n","Step two focuses on risk_log.json, telling reviewers to filter for high-severity entries, understand the risk types and context, and escalate concerning patterns to appropriate leadership. This prioritizes attention on the most critical issues rather than drowning in low-severity noise.\n","\n","Step three covers examining prompts_log.jsonl when needed. It recommends using a JSONL reader or command-line tool like jq for processing. It explains how to verify hash chain integrity by checking that each entry's hash matches the next entry's previous hash, starting from the genesis hash of sixty-four zeros. It tells reviewers to look for parse failures and check checkpoint entries for approval status. This technical guidance helps reviewers who want to dig deeper into the audit trail.\n","\n","Step four addresses reviewing deliverables per case. It advises starting with case_summary.json for overview, then examining assumption_register.json for unresolved items, checking open_items_register.json for evidence needs, and reviewing draft outputs for not verified disclaimers. This creates a systematic approach rather than randomly clicking through files.\n","\n","Step five reminds reviewers to apply firm quality control procedures, verify no overclaims exist, confirm facts versus assumptions are distinguished, and check that authority references remain flagged as not verified. This connects the automated controls back to professional responsibilities.\n","\n","**How to Reproduce This Run: Reproducibility Instructions**\n","\n","The README includes detailed reproduction instructions covering four aspects. Environment setup lists the Python version, platform, and key packages from the manifest. Model configuration shows the exact model name, temperature, max tokens, and config hash. Input data explains where to find case inputs in the case summaries and emphasizes using identical sanitized facts and checkpoint decisions. Verification guidance explains comparing config hashes between runs, checking hash chain immutability, and understanding that risk patterns should be similar but not identical due to model stochasticity.\n","\n","These reproduction instructions matter because professional work sometimes requires verification or investigation months or years later. If someone questions a result or wants to understand why something happened, they can follow these instructions to recreate similar conditions and see whether they get comparable outcomes.\n","\n","**Level 3 Boundary Reminder: Restating Limitations**\n","\n","The README repeats the critical boundary between what Level 3 agents do and don't do. It uses checkmarks to list what agents do: structure intake, propose workflow plans, draft planning artifacts, flag risks, and maintain audit trails. It uses X marks to list what agents don't do: perform audit procedures, obtain or verify evidence, make authoritative conclusions, replace professional judgment, or execute without human checkpoints. This repetition throughout the documentation reinforces the limitations so no one misunderstands the system's role.\n","\n","**Checkpoint Approval Meaning: Clarifying Intent**\n","\n","The README explicitly clarifies what checkpoint approvals mean and don't mean. An approval means reviewed draft and approved to proceed to next step. It does not mean verified truth of all statements, confirmed compliance with standards, or engagement sign-off. The README lists four requirements for all draft artifacts: senior CPA review, engagement-level quality control, proper sign-off per firm policies, and independence and ethics compliance. This prevents anyone from treating automated approvals in demo mode as if they were professional sign-offs.\n","\n","**Creating the Zip Bundle: One-File Packaging**\n","\n","After creating the README, the cell uses Python's shutil library to create a zip archive containing the entire run directory. The zip filename includes the run identifier, making it easy to distinguish multiple run bundles. The cell prints the zip file path so you know exactly where to find it for download.\n","\n","**File List and Checklist: Verification Before Closing**\n","\n","The cell prints a complete file list showing every file in the bundle with its relative path and size in bytes. This transparency lets reviewers see exactly what they're getting. The cell also prints a checklist confirming each expected artifact exists: manifest, prompts log, risk log, README, deliverables folder, and zip bundle. Green checkmarks appear for files that exist, red X marks for anything missing. This final verification catches any problems before you consider the run complete.\n","\n","**Summary Statistics: Quantitative Overview**\n","\n","The cell concludes with summary statistics providing quantitative measures of the run. It counts total cases processed, checkpoint approvals logged, LLM calls made, risk entries created with breakdown by severity, deliverables generated, and total files in bundle. These numbers give you a quick sense of the run's scope and complexity. A run with fifty LLM calls and thirty risk entries tells a different story than a run with ten calls and three risks.\n","\n","**Completion Message: Next Steps**\n","\n","The final output provides a completion message with the zip file path and explicit next steps. It reminds you to download the zip from Colab's file panel, extract and review the AUDIT README, apply firm QC procedures, and remember that all outputs require CPA review and engagement sign-off. This guidance prevents the workflow from ending ambiguously, instead providing clear direction about what to do with the artifacts you've created."],"metadata":{"id":"QktoO36gNwPN"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###10.2.CODE AND IMPLEMENTATION"],"metadata":{"id":"-qPlPvQYNhIv"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Cell 10: Bundle + Audit README + Zip\n","\n","import shutil\n","\n","# ============================================================================\n","# CREATE AUDIT README\n","# ============================================================================\n","\n","audit_readme_content = f\"\"\"\n","AUDIT README - AI Agents Chapter 3 Level 3 Run\n","{'='*60}\n","\n","Run ID: {RUN_ID}\n","Timestamp: {now_iso()}\n","Author: Alejandro Reynoso, Chief Scientist DEFI CAPITAL RESEARCH\n","        External Lecturer, Judge Business School Cambridge\n","\n","{'='*60}\n","WHAT IS IN THIS BUNDLE\n","{'='*60}\n","\n","This bundle contains a complete audit trail for a Level 3 agent workflow run:\n","\n","1. run_manifest.json\n","   - Run identification (run_id, timestamp)\n","   - Model configuration (model, temperature, max_tokens)\n","   - Config hash (for deterministic verification)\n","   - Environment fingerprint (Python version, OS, key packages)\n","   - Governance principle: capability↑ ⇒ risk↑ ⇒ controls↑\n","\n","2. prompts_log.jsonl\n","   - Append-only log of all LLM interactions (REDACTED)\n","   - Each entry includes:\n","     * Redacted prompt/response (truncated for privacy)\n","     * SHA-256 hashes (prompt_hash, response_hash)\n","     * Hash chain (prev_entry_hash, entry_hash) for immutability\n","     * Agent name, step ID, case ID, timestamp\n","     * Model parameters, parse status, checkpoint name\n","   - TREAT AS SENSITIVE even though redacted\n","   - Use for audit trail, not for re-prompting\n","\n","3. risk_log.json\n","   - Risk register entries per step and deliverable\n","   - Risk types: confidentiality, hallucination, qc, prompt_injection,\n","                 hinge_fact_unresolved_block, workflow_integrity_gap, etc.\n","   - Severity levels: low, medium, high\n","   - Review all \"high\" severity entries carefully\n","\n","4. deliverables/\n","   - Folder structure: deliverables/<case_id>/v001_<artifact>.json\n","   - Each case has its own subfolder\n","   - Versioned artifacts (v001, v002, etc.)\n","   - JSON format (structured data) + optional .txt (human-readable)\n","   - Includes:\n","     * Step outputs (intake, plan, drafts)\n","     * QC review notes\n","     * Assumption register\n","     * Open items register\n","     * Case summary\n","\n","{'='*60}\n","HOW TO REVIEW THIS RUN\n","{'='*60}\n","\n","Step 1: Review run_manifest.json\n","- Verify config matches expectations\n","- Note config_hash and environment fingerprint\n","- Confirm governance controls are listed\n","\n","Step 2: Check risk_log.json\n","- Filter for severity=\"high\"\n","- Understand risk types and context\n","- Escalate any concerning patterns\n","\n","Step 3: Examine prompts_log.jsonl (if needed)\n","- Use a JSONL reader or `jq` tool\n","- Verify hash chain integrity:\n","  * Each entry's entry_hash should match next entry's prev_entry_hash\n","  * Genesis hash is 64 zeros\n","- Look for parse_status=\"fail\" (JSON parsing issues)\n","- Check checkpoint entries for approval status\n","\n","Step 4: Review deliverables per case\n","- Each case folder contains all outputs\n","- Start with case_summary.json for overview\n","- Review assumption_register.json for unresolved items\n","- Check open_items_register.json for evidence needs\n","- Examine draft outputs for \"Not verified\" disclaimers\n","\n","Step 5: Apply firm QC procedures\n","- Remember: ALL outputs are DRAFTS requiring CPA review\n","- Verify no overclaims or implied performance\n","- Confirm facts vs assumptions are clearly distinguished\n","- Check that authority references (ASC/PCAOB/etc) are flagged \"Not verified\"\n","\n","{'='*60}\n","HOW TO REPRODUCE THIS RUN\n","{'='*60}\n","\n","To reproduce this run (for verification or audit purposes):\n","\n","1.

What began as a discussion of risks and controls evolved into a working system that processes real cases, enforces quality gates, maintains audit trails, and produces reviewable deliverables. The progression wasn't accidental. It mirrors how professional firms should approach AI adoption: starting with clear boundaries, building controls into the foundation, and only then unleashing capability.\n","\n","**What We Built Together: A Step-by-Step Journey**\n","\n","We started by establishing the philosophical foundation in Cell 1, clearly articulating what Level 3 agents do and don't do. This wasn't mere disclaimer language. It was a stake in the ground declaring that agents orchestrate workflows with human oversight but never perform procedures, obtain evidence, or verify facts. We emphasized the core principle that capability increases risk which demands increased controls, setting expectations that the notebook would prioritize safety over speed and governance over convenience.\n","\n","Cell 2 created the basic infrastructure, installing necessary packages and establishing the run directory where all artifacts would live. This seemingly mundane setup mattered because it established the discipline of isolated, versioned runs rather than letting files scatter across random locations. Cell 3 connected to the Anthropic API, configuring the exact model version, temperature, and token limits that would govern all AI interactions. By documenting these parameters explicitly, we enabled reproducibility and made configuration part of the auditable record rather than hidden magic.\n","\n","Cell 4 built the governance backbone: utility functions for timestamping, hashing, and file operations; the environment fingerprint capturing your computing context; the base configuration documenting all controls and checkpoints; and the initialization of manifest and log files. This cell operationalized the principle of governance-first architecture. Before a single AI call could happen, the audit trail infrastructure had to exist. This inverted approach prevents the common failure pattern where teams build capability first and retrofit governance later, inevitably leaving gaps.\n","\n","Cell 5 implemented confidentiality protections through three critical utilities. The redaction function automatically masked emails, phone numbers, social security numbers, and addresses before any data entered logs or got transmitted to Claude. The minimum-necessary builder extracted core facts while filtering excessive detail. The prompt injection scanner detected suspicious patterns indicating manipulation attempts. Together, these three utilities created defense in depth, where multiple layers of protection reduced the chance that confidential information would leak or malicious inputs would succeed.\n","\n","Cell 6 created the intelligent wrapper around Claude that enforced structured outputs, implemented retry logic for parse failures, maintained the cryptographic hash chain for immutable logging, and automatically flagged risks like missing questions, authority tokens, implied performance verbs, and authoritative conclusions. This wrapper transformed Claude from a general-purpose AI into a specialized tool constrained by professional services requirements. Every interaction passed through quality checks before results could propagate through the workflow.\n","\n","Cell 7 introduced the specialist agents and control mechanisms. We implemented five agent classes handling intake, planning, drafting, quality control, and risk assessment. We created registers for tracking assumptions, open items, and unverified statements. We built the checkpoint gate that blocks workflow progression until human approval is granted. Most importantly, we implemented hinge fact blocking where unresolved critical unknowns prevent drafting work that depends on knowing those facts. This cell showed how to encode professional judgment rules into automated controls without eliminating human decision-making.\n","\n","Cell 8 constructed the orchestrator that coordinates all specialists through a six-stage state machine with checkpoints between stages. The orchestrator doesn't just call agents in sequence, it maintains state across steps, versions all deliverables, adapts artifact selection to case types, and fails safely when problems occur. This cell demonstrated that agentic workflows require explicit orchestration rather than hoping specialists will coordinate themselves through emergent behavior.\n","\n","Cell 9 ran four demonstration cases showing the complete system working on realistic scenarios. A financial statement audit with revenue variance analysis. An internal control review with incomplete walkthrough notes. A tax uncertain position requiring documentation without authority text provided. A training materials request asking the system to explain itself. These diverse cases proved the framework's flexibility while revealing how intentionally incomplete inputs force proper acknowledgment of gaps rather than fabrication of missing information.\n","\n","Cell 10 wrapped everything into a reviewable package with comprehensive README documentation explaining what each artifact contains, how to review the run systematically, how to reproduce results for verification, what Level 3 boundaries mean in practice, and what checkpoint approvals represent versus what they don't represent. The final zip bundle provided a complete audit trail ready for archival storage or peer review.\n","\n","**From Notebook to Practice: The Path Forward**\n","\n","The transition from running this notebook to deploying similar systems in production requires additional considerations. You'll need to integrate with firm document management systems rather than saving to local folders. You'll need authentication and authorization controlling who can run workflows and approve checkpoints. You'll need monitoring dashboards showing active workflows, pending approvals, and risk flag summaries. You'll need retention policies determining how long to keep logs and when to archive completed bundles.\n","\n","But the fundamental architecture demonstrated here, with its specialist agents, checkpoint gates, assumption registers, immutable logs, and automated risk detection, translates directly to production environments. The governance principles don't change when you scale from demonstration notebooks to firm-wide deployment. If anything, they become more critical as volume increases and consequences grow.\n","\n","**The Larger Contribution: A Template for Responsible AI**\n","\n","This notebook's contribution extends beyond the specific implementation to the broader question of how professions should adopt AI. The approach demonstrated here, building controls into the foundation rather than bolting them on afterward, provides a template applicable across professional services. Legal professionals drafting contracts, healthcare providers diagnosing conditions, financial advisors recommending investments, all face similar challenges around maintaining quality standards, protecting confidential information, and preserving human judgment while leveraging AI capabilities.\n","\n","The specific controls will differ across contexts. Healthcare might emphasize different risk types than accounting. Legal work might require different checkpoint gates than auditing. But the architectural pattern of specialist agents coordinated through orchestrated workflows with human gates, explicit assumption tracking, immutable audit trails, and automated risk detection applies broadly. Professions adopting AI don't need to reinvent governance frameworks, they can adapt the pattern demonstrated here to their specific requirements and risk profiles.\n","\n","**Your Next Steps: Learning by Modifying**\n","\n","The best way to deepen your understanding is by modifying this notebook. Try adding a fifth demonstration case from your own practice area. Implement an additional specialist agent handling a task currently performed manually. Create new automated risk flags detecting patterns specific to your firm's quality control concerns. Experiment with different checkpoint configurations, perhaps adding preliminary review gates or removing final sign-off for low-risk cases. Each modification will teach you something about how the governance system works and where its flexibility lies.\n","\n","Most importantly, reflect on what this experience teaches about the relationship between AI capabilities and professional responsibility. The technology empowers us to work faster and handle greater complexity, but it doesn't eliminate our obligation to exercise professional judgment, maintain quality standards, protect client interests, and stand behind our work. This notebook showed how to build systems that respect that relationship, making professionals more capable while keeping them firmly in control. That balance, between capability and responsibility, will define whether AI becomes a force for elevating professional services or a source of systemic risk. The choice belongs to us.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"aV65a4QjNzQV"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"3BdM6IPANlZ-"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
